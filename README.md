            stadium, enclosure that combines broad space for athletic games and other exhibitions with large seating capacity for 
            spectators. The name derives from the Greek unit of measurement, the stade, the distance covered in the original Greek footraces 
            (about 600 feet [180 metres]). a large closed area of land with rows of seats around the sides and often with no roof, used for sports events and musical performances:
             Thousands of fans packed into the stadium to watch the match.
             Large open structures that have space for athletic events and other kinds of entertainment, as well as seating for spectators, 
             are called stadiums or arenas.
              The word stadium is a Latinized form of the Greek stade, a length of about 606 feet (185 meters).
